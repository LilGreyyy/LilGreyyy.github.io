            <a>6 years since elementary school, 
            3rd grade, I started playing volleyball. 
            This sport interested me very much then, 
            and I would like to continue playing volleyball.</a>

            <h3>Singing</h3>
            <a>From the first to the ninth grade, 
                I was engaged in singing, went to the choir and ensemble, 
                and also sang in a duet. Music is something I kind of can't live without. 
                Every time I go somewhere I turn on my favorite playlist</a>

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <a>I started to get involved in programming most of all not long before the technical school, 
                and I am most interested in web programming than in the development of programs / games</a>
